maxscript-mode2
===============

emacs major mode for editing MaxScript files.

Google says there's an existing maxscript-mode that somebody made, at
http://code.google.com/p/maxscript-mode/ - but it gives a 404. So
here's another one. 

Perhaps the original will return, so I put a 2 on the end of the file
name. This is purely for disambiguation. Under the assumption that
you'll actually be using one or the other, the symbol prefix is plain
old "maxscript".
